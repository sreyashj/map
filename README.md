# Language Map
This is a website landing page to assit the website user to pick the language that they would like to view the content in by placing the 
cursor over the country in which the language is spoken and then clicking, the page would then redirect the user to the appropriate site 
translated to the correct language. To make this website interesting we shall make use of some cool animations and soothing colors to make
it more of a fun activity for the website user to take part in rather than clicking a language from a dropdown box.

## Motivation
From a through analysis of every day websites we have identified one thing in common, most of the websites just use traditional means of 
having a user select a language from a dropdown box. As we can see below the traditionl means is very boring:

## Goals for this project
We aim to make a Language map which will not only help users interact more with the website but also help them familiarize themselves with
the world in general. By clicking on countries on the map we are not only selecting the langiage that we want to view the website in but subconciasly we are also learning the world alittle bit more each time. We have identified the following list of functionalities that our map
will serve:

- Map should be easily customisable according to the website its being attached
- The map will display the language of the country thats clicked on
- When a country is selected it will highlight and text will appear of the country and language that is spoken there
- The website will make use of proceed notification box to verify the users choice
- A latter addition will be sound integration which will ask the user a question in the language and they have to type an answer before proceeding
